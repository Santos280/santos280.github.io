# About me
<!--<img src="/Pictures/My Pic.JPG" width="200" height="200">-->


I am an Embedded Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience across automotive and semiconductor domains, specializing in embedded Linux, kernel development, and real-time systems. My background includes building custom CAN FD acquisition tools, low-level device drivers, and high-throughput data pipelines on platforms ranging from STM32 and NI-PXI to full embedded Linux systems.

I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of hardware and software—whether developing kernel modules for memory-mapped I/O, or automating complex ECU validation workflows. I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University and actively seeking full-time roles in embedded software and firmware engineering.

# My Projects
## **1. Wake word detection on Raspberry Pi:**
### [Project link](https://www.hackster.io/shubhamsantosh99/linux-kernel-driver-on-raspberry-pi-c0a975)
<img src="https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1920522/_wkvxwNVUAQ.blob?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=900&h=675&fit=min" width="300" height="200">
<!--![project_cover_pic](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1808181/_i0aaUeJIPP.blob?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=900&h=675&fit=min)-->

   Developed a Linux kernel device driver for an MPU6050 IMU on Raspberry Pi using the I²C protocol, progressing from user-space drivers to a kernel-space implementation with the Industrial I/O (IIO) subsystem for buffered sensor streaming. Gained hands-on experience with device tree overlays, sysfs, and mainline Linux kernel source code.

## **2. Wake word detection on Raspberry Pi:**

   Developed a RNN model for wake word detection that captures an image when the user speaks 'raspi' into the microphone. 
   
   The live inferncing on the Raspberry Pi is done using INMP441 MEMS microphone interfaced using SPI protocol. Raspberry Pi Camera module 3 is used for capturing 640x480 resolution images.

   Necessary optimizations are performed for the audio sampling rate, feature size and the RNN layers for a faster response on the Raspberry Pi.

## **3. ECEN 649(Pattern Recognion) Term project: Detection of Industrial Machine Failures using Supervised Learning Algorithms(Team of 2)**

### [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i8vVw6WteHmv9AYTYrD_h9ytyVw0N6nX/view?usp=drive_link)
   
   Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach aimed at minimizing financial losses and operational disruptions in large industries through addressing unplanned equipment failures, particularly motor failures such as bearing breakdowns.

   This project aims at comparing different neural network architectures trained on the multiclass classification dataset using different optimization methods and activation functions. Specifically, the performances of Simple, Medium, and Deep Neural Networks are compared and combined with three renowned optimizers—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop—adding the most used activation functions: ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid.

   Our results show that the Simple Neural Network, trained with the Adam optimizer and the ReLU activation function, has obtained the best accuracy at 98%.

## **4. ECEN-602 Machine Problem: SBCP Message Broadcast using Socket Programming(Team of 2)**

### [GitHub Link](https://github.com/shubham1384-tamu/ECEN602-MP2-SBCP_message_broadcast)

   Developed an application that allows multiple clients to communicate with each other using a common server that accepts and broadcasts messages in SBCP format.

   The entrie code was develped in C language and my responsibilities were developing the server code with functionalities such as rejecting duplicate client names with NACK and allowing server child process to handle clients upto a certain threshold.



# My hobbies

## Calisthenics
Every Year I keep a goal to learn a new calisthenics skill. My main area of focus is dynamic movements and my recent interest has been towards the handstand progression.

### My current progression: L-sit to Handstand

## Cycling
Cycling has always been a hobby since I was a kid. I would usually go on weekends on trails with my friends. My greatest achievemet was covering the city of Mysore,India via the outer ring road.
