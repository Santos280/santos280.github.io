# About me

My name is Shubham Santosh and I am a Computer Engineering graduate student at Texas A&M University, specializing in Embedded Software/Firmware with a focus on Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML).

Previously, I worked in the Embedded V&V domain at L&T Technology Services, where I developed automated test cases and performed Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing for automotive ECUs. During my tenure, I gained extensive experience with NI-LabVIEW, NI-VeriStand, the Python Selenium module, and OOP concepts in C++.

I have a keen interest in embedded programming and have experience working with microcontrollers such as Atmega328, STM32, and RP2040, with strong proficiency in embedded C. I am currently exploring embedded Machine Learning, enabling ML capabilities to edge devices.

## My Projects
1. **Wake word detection on Raspberry Pi:**
   
   Developed a RNN model for wake word detection that captures an image when the user speaks 'raspi' into the microphone. 
   
   The live inferncing on the Raspberry Pi was done using INMP441 MEMS microphone interfaced using SPI protocol. Audio acquisition was done using sounddevice module and feature extraction was done using sounddevice module. Rpi Camera module 3 was used for capturing 640 X 480 resolution images.

2. **Detection of Industrial Machine failures using Supervised ML algorithms**


## My hobbies

<!--### Calisthenics
Every Year I keep a goal to learn a new calisthenics skill. My interest has been towards handstands.

2024 Dec progress: Multiple handstand pushup

2024 Jan progress: Unlocked the L-Sit to Handstand

2023 progress: Unlocked the Muscle-ups
