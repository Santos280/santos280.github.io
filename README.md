My name is Shubham Santosh and I am a Computer Engineering graduate student at Texas A&M University, specializing in Embedded Software/Firmware with a focus on Computer Vision (CV) and Machine Learning (ML).

I have a keen interest in embedded programming and have experience working with microcontrollers such as Atmega328, STM32, and RP2040, with strong proficiency in embedded C. I am currently exploring embedded Machine Learning, enabling ML capabilities to edge devices.

## **1. Wake word detection on Raspberry Pi:**

<!--![project_cover_pic](https://hackster.imgix.net/uploads/attachments/1808181/_i0aaUeJIPP.blob?auto=compress%2Cformat&w=900&h=675&fit=min)-->

   Developed a RNN model for wake word detection that captures an image when the user speaks 'raspi' into the microphone. 
   
   The live inferncing on the Raspberry Pi is done using INMP441 MEMS microphone interfaced using SPI protocol. Raspberry Pi Camera module 3 is used for capturing 640x480 resolution images.

   Necessary optimizations are performed for the audio sampling rate, feature size and the RNN layers for a faster response on the Raspberry Pi.

## **2. ECEN 649(Pattern Recognion) Term project: Detection of Industrial Machine Failures using Supervised Learning Algorithms(Team of 2)**

### [Project Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i8vVw6WteHmv9AYTYrD_h9ytyVw0N6nX/view?usp=drive_link)
   
   Predictive maintenance is a proactive approach aimed at minimizing financial losses and operational disruptions in large industries through addressing unplanned equipment failures, particularly motor failures such as bearing breakdowns.

   This project aims at comparing different neural network architectures trained on the multiclass classification dataset using different optimization methods and activation functions. Specifically, the performances of Simple, Medium, and Deep Neural Networks are compared and combined with three renowned optimizers—Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop—adding the most used activation functions: ReLU, Tanh, and Sigmoid.

   Our results show that the Simple Neural Network, trained with the Adam optimizer and the ReLU activation function, has obtained the best accuracy at 98%.

## **3. ECEN-602 Machine Problem: SBCP Message Broadcast using Socket Programming(Team of 2)**

### [GitHub Link](https://github.com/shubham1384-tamu/ECEN602-MP2-SBCP_message_broadcast)

   Developed an application that allows multiple clients to communicate with each other using a common server that accepts and broadcasts messages in SBCP format.

   The entrie code was develped in C language and my responsibilities were developing the server code with functionalities such as rejecting duplicate client names with NACK and allowing server child process to handle clients upto a certain threshold.



# My hobbies

## Calisthenics
Every Year I keep a goal to learn a new calisthenics skill. My main area of focus is dynamic movements and my recent interest has been towards the handstand progression.

### My current progression: L-sit to Handstand

## Cycling
Cycling has always been a hobby since I was a kid. I would usually go on weekends on trails with my friends. My greatest achievemet was covering the city of Mysore,India via the outer ring road.
